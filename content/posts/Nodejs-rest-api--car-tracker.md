#### LET'S TRACK CARS!
Ever had too many cars and need to keep track of them all? Me neither. Ever looked at every car driving by throughout the day and want to track each one somewhere? Didn't think so. BUT, what if we _did_ have too many cars?  What if we _did_ need to track them all? I think it's important to be prepared for when that day comes. So, let's build a thing!

#### We're building...
 - A RESTful API with Nodejs and Typescript!
 - A quick and dirty front end that will let us add, remove, update, and delete cars and associated information.
 - A database to store our cars data

#### Getting started

A _very_ good place to start when building an API is [swagger](https://swagger.io/).  This is a very commonly used tool in the industry that helps build and document your API endpoints.  Our _very first step_ in building this cars API is going to be outlining it in the [swagger editor](http://editor.swagger.io/). Take a look at this tool and mess around with it for a few minutes before moving on to the next paragraph.  You'll very quickly see how useful this tool is and why we'd want to use it.

Ok, so I've gone to the trouble of building out all the pieces we'll need for the API.  Here's the final result:

```yaml

```
